# EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO FEEL SAFE
Everyone has a right to feel physically and emotionally safe at ConFest. There are few rules at ConFest, but those around safety must be strictly adhered to.  
*There are a number of volunteer crews set up to enforce and promote safe interactions and activities.  These include the first aid and fire crews, the wellness team (for emotional support) and the well being team to deal with any anti social behaviour.

# Camp fires are provided 
Our team of volunteers have provided safe places for you to gather and enjoy the warmth and atmosphere of a camp fire, and have a space to cook. No fires are allowed outside of these spaces. This means no naked flames such as candles or gas cooking can occur outside these spaces. Feel free to  use the facilities provided or carry your gas cooker into a designated cooking area.

# TAKE YOUR RUBBISH HOME
Carry in, carry out - anything you bring on site needs to leave with you. This includes any and all rubbish - it is your responsibility. Double bag it and take it home.
 Please do not leave rubbish in onsite dumpsters or in Deniliquin or Moulamein. [They are our neighbours and deserve our respect.] Please respect our neighbours and our volunteers - leave no trace except for footprints.

# WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY
Remove yourself from the danger.
Send/radio for help
The emergency assembly area is located in STAY PUT camping north of the market.  In the event of a fire everyone must move to the assembly area. DO NOT GO TO YOUR CAR. **DO NOT SEEK REFUGE IN YOUR CAR.**

# CARS at ConFest
**STAY PUT** camping means just that: STAY PUT!  Once you have camped cars must remain stationary until Monday 12pm. This is for everyone's safety especially our children.
If you need to leave the site park in the car park or **ACCESS camping** (adjacent the car park), but really, everything you need is here, so why would you leave ConFest?
**BUSES** run everyday of the festival and will take you into **CAR FREE** camping.  Drop your stuff at the bus stop near **WELCOME** park in the **CAR PARK** and drink chai while you wait.
